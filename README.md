Image captioning is a task in computer vision and natural language processing that involves generating textual descriptions or captions for images. The goal is to automatically generate accurate and meaningful descriptions that capture the content and context of the given image. Image captioning combines computer vision techniques, such as image recognition and feature extraction, with natural language processing techniques, such as language modeling and sequence generation.
The model in the notebook learns to associate the visual features of the image with the textual descriptions provided.
